# Glyphs

Each Eremos agent uses a symbolic glyph to identify its signature in logs and signals.

| Glyph | Agent     | Meaning             |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|
| Ϸ     | Theron    | Memory / Echo       |
| Δ     | Observer  | Detection / Signal  |
| λ     | Harvester | Flow / Indexing     |

Glyphs are used in:
- `logSignal()`
- visualizations
- agent memory logs
